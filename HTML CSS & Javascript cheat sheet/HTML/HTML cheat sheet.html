        <h3>Elements</h3>

          <h4>HTML</h4>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to give content to a web page and
            instructs web browsers on how to structure that content.</p>

          <h4>Element Content</h4>
            <p>The content of an HTML element is the information between the opening and closing tags of an element.</p>

          <h4> List Item Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;li&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;li&gt; list item element create list items inside:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ordered lists &lt;ol&gt;</li>
                  <li>Unordered lists &lt;ul&gt;</li>
                </ul>

          <h4>Video Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;video&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;video&gt; element embeds a media player for video playback. The src attribute will contain the URL
              to the video. Adding the controls attribute will display video controls in the media player.</p>
              <p><bold>Note:</bold>The content inside the opening and closing tag is shown as a fallback in browsers
              that don’t support the element.</p>

          <h4>Emphasis Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;em&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;em&gt; element emphasizes text and browsers will usually italicize the emphasized text by default.</p>

          <h4>Ordered List Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;ol&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;ol&gt; ordered list element creates a list of items in sequential order. Each list item appears
              numbered by default.</p>

          <h4>Div Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;div&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;div&gt; element is used as a container that divides an HTML document into sections and is short for
              “division”. &lt;div&gt; elements can contain flow content such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.</p>

          <h4>HTML Structure</h4>
            <p>HTML is organized into a family tree structure. HTML elements can have parents, grandparents, siblings,
            children, grandchildren, etc.</p>

          <h4>Closing Tag</h4>
            <p>An HTML closing tag is used to denote the end of an HTML element. The syntax for a closing tag is a left
            angle bracket &lt; followed by a forward slash / then the element name and a right angle bracket to close &gt;.</p>

          <h4>Attribute Name and Values</h4>
            <p>HTML attributes consist of a name and a value using the following syntax: name="value" and can be added to the
            opening tag of an HTML element to configure or change the behavior of the element.
            </p>

          <h4>&lt;br&gt; Line Break Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;br&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;br&gt; line break element will create a line break in text and is especially useful where a division of text is
              required, like in a postal address. The line break element requires only an opening tag and must not have a closing
              tag.</p>

          <h4>Image Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;img&gt;</h5>
              <p>HTML image &lt;img&gt; elements embed images in documents. The src attribute contains the image URL and is mandatory.
              &lt;img&gt; is an empty element meaning it should not have a closing tag.</p>

          <h4>Heading Elements</h4>
            <h5>&lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;</h5>
              <p>HTML can use six different levels of heading elements. The heading elements are ordered from the highest level &lt;h1&gt;
              to the lowest level &lt;h6&gt;.</p>

          <h4><p> Paragraph Element</h4>
            <p>The &lt;p&gt; paragraph element contains and displays a block of text.</p>

          <h4>Unique ID Attributes</h4>
            <p>In HTML, specific and unique id attributes can be assigned to different elements in order to differentiate between them.</p>
            <p>When needed, the id value can be called upon by CSS and JavaScript to manipulate, format, and perform specific instructions
            on that element and that element only. Valid id attributes should begin with a letter and should only contain letters (a-Z),
            digits (0-9), hyphens (-), underscores (_), and periods (.).</p>

          <h4>HTML Attributes</h4>
            <p>HTML attributes are values added to the opening tag of an element to configure the element or change the element’s default
            behavior. In the provided example, we are giving the &lt;p&gt; (paragraph) element a unique identifier using the id attribute and
            changing the color of the default text using the style attribute.</p>

          <h4>Unordered List Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;ul&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;ul&gt; unordered list element is used to create a list of items in no particular order. Each individual list item will
              have a bullet point by default.</p>

          <h4><em>alt</em> Attribute</h4>
            <p>An &lt;img&gt; element can have alternative text via the <em>alt</em> attribute. The alternative text will be displayed if an image fails
            to render due to an incorrect URL, if the image format is not supported by the browser, if the image is blocked from being
            displayed, or if the image has not been received from the URL.</p>
            <p>The text will be read aloud if screen reading software is used and helps support visually impaired users by providing a text descriptor
            for the image content on a webpage.</p>

          <h4>Body Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;body&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;body&gt; element represents the content of an HTML document. Content inside &lt;body&gt; tags are rendered on the web browsers.</p>
              <p><b>Note:</b>There can be only one &lt;body&gt; element in a document.</p>

          <h4>Span Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;span&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;span&gt; element is an inline container for text and can be used to group text for styling purposes. However, as &lt;span&gt; is a generic
              container to separate pieces of text from a larger body of text, its use should be avoided if a more semantic element is available.</p>

          <h4>Strong Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;strong&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;strong&gt; element highlights important, serious, or urgent text and browsers will normally render this highlighted text in
              bold by default.</p>

          <h4>HTML Element</h4>
            <p>An HTML element is a piece of content in an HTML document and uses the following syntax: opening tag + content + closing tag.
            In the code provided:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>&lt;p&gt; is the opening tag.</li>
                <li>Hello World! is the content.</li>
                <li>&lt;/p&gt; is the closing tag.</li>
              </ul>

          <h4>HTML Tag</h4>
            <p>The syntax for a single HTML tag is an opening angle bracket &lt; followed by the element name and a closing angle bracket &gt;.
            Here is an example of an opening &lt;div&gt; tag.</p>

    <!-- Structure -->

        <h3>Structure</h3>

          <h4>Anchor Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;a&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;a&gt; anchor element is used to create hyperlinks in an HTML document. The hyperlinks can point to other webpages, files on the
              same server, a location on the same page, or any other URL via the hyperlink reference attribute, href. The href determines the location
              the anchor element points to.</p>

          <h4>Head Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;head&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;head&gt; element contains general information about an HTML page that isn’t displayed on the page itself. This information is called
              metadata and includes things like the title of the HTML document and links to stylesheets.</p>

          <h4>Target Attribute</h4>
            <h5>&lt;target&gt;</h5>
            <p>The target attribute on an &lt;a&gt; anchor element specifies where a hyperlink should be opened. A target value of "_blank" will tell the browser
            to open the hyperlink in a new tab in modern browsers, or in a new window in older browsers or if the browser has had settings changed to open hyperlinks in a new window.</p>

          <h4>Indentation</h4>
            <p>HTML code should be formatted such that the indentation level of text increases once for each level of nesting.</p>
            <p>It is a common convention to use two or four space per level of nesting.</p>

          <h4>Link to a Different Part of the Page #</h4>
            <p>The anchor element &lt;a&gt; can create hyperlinks to different parts of the same HTML document using the href attribute to point to the desired location
            with # followed by the id of the element to link to.</p>

          <h4>HTML Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;html&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;html&gt; element, the root of an HTML document, should be added after the !DOCTYPE declaration. All content/structure for an HTML document should
              be contained between the opening and closing &lt;html&gt; tags.</p>

          <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>In HTML, comments can be added between an opening &lt;!-- and closing --&gt;. Content inside of comments will not be rendered by browsers, and are
            usually used to describe a part of code or provide other details.</p>

            <p>Comments can span single or multiple lines.</p>

          <h4>Whitespace</h4>
            <p>Whitespace, such as line breaks, added to an HTML document between block-level elements will generally be ignored by the browser and are not added
            to increase spacing on the rendered HTML page. Rather, whitespace is added for organization and easier reading of the HTML document itself.</p>

          <h4>Title Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;title&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;title&gt; element contains a text that defines the title of an HTML document. The title is displayed in the browser’s title bar or tab in which
              the HTML page is displayed. The &lt;title&gt; element can only be contained inside a document’s &lt;head&gt; element.</p>

          <h4>File Path</h4>
            <p>URL paths in HTML can be absolute paths, like a full URL, for example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn or a relative file path that
            links to a local file in the same folder or on the same server, for example: ./style.css. Relative file paths begin with ./ followed by a path to the
            local file. ./ tells the browser to look for the file path from the current folder.</p>

          <h4>Document Type Declaration</h4>
            <h5>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</h5>
              <p>The document type declaration &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is required as the first line of an HTML document. The doctype declaration is an instruction to the
              browser about what type of document to expect and which version of HTML is being used, in this case it’s HTML5.</p>

    <!-- Tables -->
        <h3>Tables</h3>

          <h4>Table Row Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;tr&gt;</h5>
              <p>The table row element, &lt;tr&gt;, is used to add rows to a table before adding table data and table headings.</p>

          <h4>Table Data Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;td&gt;</h5>
              <p>The table data element, &lt;td&gt;, can be nested inside a table row element, &lt;tr&gt;, to add a cell of data to a table.</p>

          <h4>Table Head Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;thead&gt;</h5>
              <p>The table head element, &lt;thead&gt;, defines the headings of table columns encapsulated in table rows.
              </p>

          <h4><em>rowspan</em> Attribute</h4>
            <p>Similar to <em>colspan</em>, the <em>rowspan</em> attribute on a table header or table data element indicates how many rows that
            particular cell should span within the table. The <em>rowspan</em> value is set to 1 by default and will take any positive
            integer up to 65534.</p>

          <h4>Table Body Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;tbody&gt;</h5>
              <p>The table body element, &lt;tbody&gt;, is a semantic element that will contain all table data other than table heading and table footer
              content. If used, &lt;tbody&gt; will contain all table row &lt;tr&gt; elements, and indicates that &lt;tr&gt; elements make up the body of the table.
              &lt;table&gt; cannot have both &lt;tbody&gt; and &lt;tr&gt; as direct children.</p>

          <h4>Table Heading Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;th&gt;</h5>
              <p>The table heading element, &lt;th&gt;, is used to add titles to rows and columns of a table and must be enclosed in a table row element, &lt;tr&gt;.</p>

          <h4><em>colspan</em> Attribute</h4>
            <p>The <em>colspan</em> attribute on a table header &lt;th&gt; or table data &lt;td&gt; element indicates how many columns that particular cell should span
            within the table. The colspan value is set to 1 by default and will take any positive integer between 1 and 1000.</p>

          <h4>Table Footer Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;tfoot&gt;</h5>
              <p>The table footer element, &lt;tfoot&gt;, uses table rows to give footer content or to summarize content at the end of a table.</p>

          <h4>Table Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;table&gt;</h5>
              <p>In HTML, the &lt;table&gt; element has content that is used to represent a two-dimensional table made of rows and columns.</p>



    <!-- Semantic HTML -->
        <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>

          <h4>Semantic HTML</h4>
            <p>Semantic HTML introduces meaning to the code we write. Before Semantic HTML the elements didn’t have any meaning as to what
            it does or what content goes in it. An element such as &lt;div&gt; was used as a general-purpose element to create things from headers
            to footers to articles. With Semantic HTML we were introduced to elements that tell developers and browsers exactly what it
            does and what content should go in it.</p>

          <h4>Element Placement</h4>
            <p>Semantic HTML introduces elements that can tell developers exactly what the element does or where it’s placed based on the name
            of that element. Some of these elements are &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;. &lt;header&gt; describes the content at the top of
            the page &lt;body&gt;. It may include a logo, navigational links or a search bar. &lt;nav&gt; encapsulates the page’s navigational links.
            It is often placed inside the &lt;header&gt; or &lt;footer&gt;. &lt;main&gt; encapsulates the main content of a page between the header/navigation
            and the footer areas. &lt;footer&gt; includes the page’s footer content at the bottom of the &lt;body&gt;.</p>

          <h4>Embedding media</h4>
            <p>Semantic HTML introduces us to &lt;video&gt;, &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;embed&gt;. &lt;video&gt; allows us to add videos to our website. &lt;audio&gt; allows us
            to implement audio into our website. &lt;embed&gt; can be used to implement any type of media. These elements are universal in that
            they all use the src attribute to link the source of the content. &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; requires a closing tag while &lt;embed&gt; is
            a self-closing tag.</p>

          <h4>&lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt;</h4>
            <p>The &lt;figure&gt; element is used to encapsulate media such as an image, diagram. or code snippet. The &lt;figcaption&gt; element is used to
            describe the media encapsulated within the &lt;figure&gt; element. Developers will normally use &lt;figcaption&gt; within the &lt;figure&gt; element to
            group the media and description. This way, if a developer decides to change the position of the media, the description will follow
            along with it.</p>

          <h4>&lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; </h4>
            <p>&lt;section&gt; defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme.
            &lt;article&gt; holds content that makes sense on its own such as articles, blogs, and comments. Generally developers will use
            &lt;section&gt; to define a theme for the webpage and use &lt;article&gt; to write independent content for that theme. This does not mean
            that &lt;article&gt; has to be used with &lt;section&gt;.</p>

          <h4>&lt;aside&gt; Aside Element</h4>
            <p>The &lt;aside&gt; element is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element but isn’t required in order to understand
            the main content. Usually, this information would be in a sidebar or a location where it doesn’t obstruct the main piece of content.
            An example of this would be an article that discusses how to take care of a dog and next to the article an ad would appear advertising
            a dog grooming product.</p>
