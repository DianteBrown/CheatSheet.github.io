  <!-- Colors -->
          <h3>Colors</h3>

           <h4>CSS Color Alpha Values</h4>
             <p>Alpha values determine the transparency of colors
             in CSS. Alpha values can be set for both RGB and
             HSL colors by using rgba() and hsla() and
             providing a fourth value representing alpha. Alpha
             values can range between 0.0 (totally
             transparent) and 1.0 (totally opaque).
             The CSS transparent value can also be used
             to create a fully transparent element.</p>

           <h4>CSS Hexadecimal Colors</h4>
             <p>CSS colors can be represented in hexadecimal (or
             hex) notation. Hexadecimal digits can represent
             sixteen different values using 0 - 9 and a - f .
             Hexadecimal colors are composed of 6
             characters–each group of two represents a value
             between 0 and 255 for red, green, or blue. For
             example #ff0000 is all red, no green, and no
             blue.
             When both characters of all three colors are
             repeated, hex colors can be abbreviated to only
             three values, so #0000ff could also be
             represented as #00f .</p>

           <h4>CSS HSL Colors</h4>
             <p>CSS colors can be declared with the HSL color
             system using hsl() syntax. This syntax
             contains three values: hue (the color value itself),
             saturation (intensity), and lightness.
             Hue values range from 0 to 360 while saturation
             and lightness values are represented as
             percentages.</p>

           <h4>CSS rgb() Colors</h4>
             <p>CSS colors can be declared with RGB colors using
             rgb() syntax.
             rgb() should be supplied with three values
             representing red, green, and blue. These values
             range can from 0 to 255.</p>

           <h4>Color Name Keywords</h4>
             <p>Color name keywords can be used to set color
             property values for elements in CSS.</p>



  <!-- Typography -->
          <h3>Typography</h3>

            <h4>CSS font-weight: property</h4>
              <p>The CSS font-weight property declares how thick
              or thin should be the characters of a text. Numerical values
              can be used with this property to set the thickness of the
              text. The numeric scale range of this property is from 100 to 900 and
              accepts only multiples of 100. The default value is normal while
              the default numerical value is 400. Any value less than 400 will
              have text appear lighter than the default while any numerical value
              greater than the 400 will appear bolder.</p>

            <h4>CSS (font-style:) property</h4>
              <p>The CSS font-style property determines the
              font style in which text will appear.
              It accepts italic as a value to set the font
              style to italic.</p>

            <h4>CSS @font-face rule</h4>
              <p>The CSS @font-face rule allows external fonts or
              font files to be imported directly into
              stylesheets.The location of the font file must be
              specified in the CSS rule so that the files can be
              loaded from that location. This rule also allows
              locally hosted fonts to be added using a relative
              file path instead of a web URL.</p>

            <h4>CSS Fallback Fonts</h4>
              <p>The CSS font-family property can have
              multiple fonts declared in order of preference. In
              this case the fonts following the initial font are
              known as the fallback fonts.
              If the initial value of the property fontfamily
              fails to load to the webpage, the fallback
              fonts will be used.</p>

            <h4>The CSS line-height: property</h4>
              <p>The CSS line-height property declares the
              vertical spacing between lines of text. It accepts
              both unitless numbers as a ratio (eg. 2 ) and
              numbers specified by unit as values (eg. 12px )
              but it does not accept negative numbers. A
              unitless number is an absolute value that will
              compute the line height as a ratio to the font size
              and a unit number can be any valid CSS unit (eg.
              pixels, percents, ems, rems, etc.). To set the
              line-height of the &lt;p&gt; elements to
              10px , the given CSS declaration can be used.</p>

            <h4>CSS Linking fonts</h4>
              <p>Linking fonts allow user to use web fonts in the
              document. They can be imported in an HTML
              document by using the &lt;link&gt; tag. Once the
              web font URL is placed within the href
              attribute, the imported font can then be used in
              CSS declaration.</p>


  <!-- Links and Buttons -->
          <h3>Links and Buttons</h3>
            <h4>Signifiers</h4>
              <p>In the field of user interface design, signifiers are
              indicators that offer clues about how to interact
              with new objects or situations.</p>

            <h4>The User Agent Stylesheet</h4>
              <p>The user agent stylesheet is a set of default styles
              included in the browser for use on all web pages.</p>

            <h4>Links and Button Behavior</h4>
              <p>Links and buttons should exhibit the same
              behavior across different browsers to consistently
              maintain the same experience for all users.</p>

            <h4>Link States</h4>
              <p>In a browser, links have four main states:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Normal (not clicked)</li>
                  <li>Hover</li>
                  <li>Active (Clicked)</li>
                  <li>Visited</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Link Styles</h4>
              <p>Links should be styled in a different way from their
              surrounding text.
              By default, links appear blue and underlined in
              contrast to the surrounding black text.</p>

            <h4>Anchor Text</h4>
              <p>Anchor text is the text inside of a link and is
              descriptive of the linked resource.
              It improves:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Usability</li>
                  <li>Accesibility</li>
                  <li>Search engine optimization</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>The 'title' Attribute</h4>
              <p>The title attribute can be provided to any
              HTML element.
              This attribute is used for additional context or
              advisory text for clickable elements.</p>

            <h4>Tooltips</h4>
              <p>A tooltip is a descriptive box which contains the
              text of an element’s title attribute and
              appears near the user’s cursor.</p>

            <h4>The :hover CSS Pseudo-Class</h4>
              <p>The CSS pseudo-class :hover is used to style
              an element when the mouse cursor hovers over it.</p>

            <h4>The CSS cursor Property</h4>
              <p>The CSS cursor property is used to change the
              appearance of the mouse cursor when hovering
              over an element.</p>

            <h4>Skeuomorphism</h4>
              <p>Skeuomorphism is the concept of replicating or
              imitating real-life counterparts with UI elements.</p>

            <h4>Flat Design</h4>
              <p>Flat design uses simplicity and lack of clutter for
              its UI elements.</p>

            <h4>Button Skeuomorphic Styling</h4>
              <p>A &lt;button&gt; element can incorporate
              skeuomorphic styling for a realistic 3D
              appearance.
              When pressing the button, a texture change may
              occur to make the button appear to flatten and
              pop back up when released.</p>

            <h4>Button Flat Styling</h4>
              <p>A &lt;button&gt; element can incorporate flat
              styling for a simple 2D effect.
              When pressing the button, a color change may
              occur as a signifier that the button has been
              pressed.</p>

            <h4>Button Hover State</h4>
              <p>A button can have a hover state that changes the
              appearance of a cursor when it is directly over the
              button.</p>

            <h4>Mobile Device Hover State</h4>
              <p>The hover state of buttons and links do not apply
              to mobile devices due to the lack of a cursor.</p>


  <!-- The Box Model -->
         <h3>The Box Model</h3>

          <h4>The property 'box-sizing' of CSS box model</h4>
            <p>The CSS box model is a box that wraps around an
            HTML element and controls the design and layout.
            The property box-sizing controls which
            aspect of the box is determined by the height
            and width properties. The default value of this
            property is content-box , which renders the
            actual size of the element including the content
            box; but not the paddings and borders. The value
            border-box , on the other hand, renders the
            actual size of an element including the content
            box, paddings, and borders.</p>

          <h4>CSS 'box-sizing: border-box;'</h4>
            <p>The value border-box of the box-sizing
            property for an element corresponds directly to
            the element’s total rendered size, including
            padding and border with the height and
            width properties.
            The default value of the box-sizing property
            is content-box . The value border-box is
            recommended when it is necessary to resize the
            padding and border but not just the
            content. For instance, the value border-box
            calculates an element’s height as follows:
            height = content height + padding
            + border .</p>

          <h4>CSS Margin Collapse</h4>
            <p>CSS margin collapse occurs when the top and
            bottom margins of blocks are combined into a
            single margin equal to the largest individual block
            margin.
            Margin collapse only occurs with vertical margins,
            not for horizontal margins.</p>

          <h4>CSS auto keyword</h4>
            <p>The value auto can be used with the property
            margin to horizontally center an element within
            its container. The margin property will take the
            width of the element and will split the rest of the
            space equally between the left and right margins.</p>

          <h4>Dealing with overflow</h4>
            <p>If content is too large for its container, the CSS
            overflow property will determine how the
            browser handles the problem.
            By default, it will be set to visible and the
            content will take up extra space. It can also be set
            to hidden , or to scroll , which will make the
            overflowing content accessible via scroll bars
            within the original container.</p>

          <h4>Height and Width Maximums/Minimums</h4>
            <p>The CSS min-width and min-height
            properties can be used to set a minimum width
            and minimum height of an element’s box. CSS
            max-width and max-height properties
            can be used to set maximum widths and heights
            for element boxes.</p>

          <h4>The 'visibility' Property</h4>
            <p>The CSS visibility property is used to
            render hidden objects invisible to the user,
            without removing them from the page. This
            ensures that the page structure and organization
            remain unchanged.</p>


  <!-- Selectors and Visual Rules -->
         <h3>Selectors and Visual Rules</h3>

          <h4>Class and ID Selectors</h4>
            <p>CSS classes can be reusable and applied to many
            elements. Class selectors are denoted with a
            period . followed by the class name. CSS ID
            selectors should be unique and used to style only
            a single element. ID selectors are denoted with a
            hash sign # followed by the id name.</p>

          <h4>Groups of CSS Selectors</h4>
            <p>Match multiple selectors to the same CSS rule,
            using a comma-separated list. In this example, the
            text for both h1 and h2 is set to red.</p>

          <h4>Selector Chaining</h4>
            <p>CSS selectors define the set of elements to which
            a CSS rule set applies. For instance, to select all
            &lt;p&gt; elements, the p selector can be used to
            create style rules.</p>

          <h4>Chaining Selectors</h4>
            <p>CSS selectors can be chained so that rule sets
            apply only to elements that match all criteria. For
            instance, to select &lt;h3&gt; elements that also have
            the section-heading class, the selector
            <b>h3.section-heading</b> can be used.</p>

          <h4>CSS Type Selectors</h4>
            <p>CSS type selectors are used to match all elements
            of a given type or tag name. Unlike for HTML
            syntax, we do not include the angle brackets when
            using type selectors for tag names. When using
            type selectors, elements are matched regardless
            of their nesting level in the HTML.</p>

          <h4>CSS class selectors</h4>
            <p>The CSS class selector matches elements based
            on the contents of their class attribute. For
            selecting elements having calendar-cell as
            the value of the class attribute, a . needs to
            be prepended.</p>

          <h4>HTML attribute with multiple values</h4>
            <p>Some HTML attributes can have multiple attribute
            values. Multiple attribute values are separated by a
            space between each attribute.</p>

          <h4>Selector Specificity</h4>
            <p>Specificity is a ranking system that is used when
            there are multiple conflicting property values that
            point to the same element. When determining
            which rule to apply, the selector with the highest
            specificity wins out. The most specific selector
            type is the ID selector, followed by class selectors,
            followed by type selectors. In this example, only
            color: blue will be implemented as it has an
            ID selector whereas color: red has a type
            selector.</p>

          <h4>CSS ID selectors</h4>
            <p>The CSS ID selector matches elements based on
            the contents of their id attribute. The values of
            id attribute should be unique in the entire DOM.
            For selecting the element having job-title as
            the value of the id attribute, a # needs to be
            prepended.</p>

          <h4>CSS descendant selector</h4>
            <p>The CSS descendant selector combinator is used
            to match elements that are descended from
            another matched selector. They are denoted by a
            single space between each selector and the
            descended selector. All matching elements are
            selected regardless of the nesting level in the
            HTML.</p>

          <h4>CSS declatations</h4>
            <p>In CSS, a declaration is the key-value pair of a CSS
            property and its value. CSS declarations are used
            to set style properties and construct rules to apply
            to individual or groups of elements. The property
            name and value are separated by a colon, and the
            entire declaration must be terminated by a semicolon.</p>

          <h4>Font Size</h4>
            <p>The font-size CSS property is used to set
            text sizes. Font size values can be many different
            units or types such as pixels.</p>

          <h4>Background Color</h4>
            <p>The background-color CSS property
            controls the background color of elements.</p>

          <h4>! important Rule</h4>
            <p>The CSS !important rule is used on
            declarations to override any other declarations for
            a property and ignore selector specificity.
            !important rules will ensure that a specific
            declaration always applies to the matched
            elements. However, generally it is good to avoid
            using !important as bad practice.</p>

          <h4>Opacity</h4>
            <p>The opacity CSS property can be used to
            control the transparency of an element. The value
            of this property ranges from 0 (transparent) to
            1 (opaque).</p>

          <h4>Font Weight</h4>
            <p>The font-weight CSS property can be used
            to set the weight (boldness) of text. The provided
            value can be a keyword such as bold or
            normal .</p>

          <h4>Text Align</h4>
            <p>The text-align CSS property can be used to
            set the text alignment of inline contents. This
            property can be set to these values: left ,
            right , or center .</p>

          <h4>CSS Rule Sets</h4>
            <p>A CSS rule set contains one or more selectors and
            one or more declarations. The selector(s), which in
            this example is h1 , points to an HTML element.
            The declaration(s), which in this example are
            color: blue and text-align: center
            style the element with a property and value. The
            rule set is the main building block of a CSS sheet.</p>

          <h4>Setting foreground text color in CSS</h4>
            <p>Using the color property, foreground text color
            of an element can be set in CSS. The value can be
            a valid color name supported in CSS like green
            or blue . Also, 3 digit or 6 digit color code like
            #22f or #2a2aff can be used to set the
            color.</p>

          <h4>Resource URLs</h4>
            <p>In CSS, the url() function is used to wrap
            resource URLs. These can be applied to several
            properties such as the background-image .</p>

          <h4>Background Image</h4>
            <p>The background-image CSS property sets
            the background image of an element. An image
            URL should be provided in the syntax
            url("moon.jpg") as the value of the
            property.</p>

          <h4>Font Family</h4>
            <p>The font-family CSS property is used to
            specify the typeface in a rule set. Fonts must be
            available to the browser to display correctly, either
            on the computer or linked as a web font. If a font
            value is not available, browsers will display their
            default font. When using a multi-word font name, it
            is best practice to wrap them in quotes.</p>

          <h4>Color Name Keywords</h4>
            <p>Color name keywords can be used to set color
            property values for elements in CSS.</p>

          <h4>Link Element</h4>
            <h5>&lt;link&gt;</h5>
              <p>The &lt;link&gt; element is used to link HTML
              documents to external resources like CSS files. It
              commonly uses:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>href attribute to specify the URL to the
                external resource</li>
                <li>rel attribute to specify the relationship
                of the linked document to the current
                document</li>
                <li>type attribute to define the type of
                content being linked</li>
              </ul>

          <h4>Purpose of CSS</h4>
            <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that
            is used in combination with HTML that customizes
            how HTML elements will appear. CSS can define
            styles and change the layout and design of a
            sheet.</p>

          <h4>Write CSS in Separate Files</h4>
            <p>CSS code can be written in its own files to keep it
            separate from the HTML code. The extension for
            CSS files is .css. These can be linked to an HTML
            file using a &lt;link&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt;
            section.</p>

          <h4>Write CSS in HTML File</h4>
            <p>CSS code can be written in an HTML file by
            enclosing the code in &lt;style&gt; tags. Code
            surrounded by &lt;style&gt; tags will be interpreted
            as CSS syntax.</p>

          <h4>Inline Styles</h4>
            <p>CSS styles can be directly added to HTML
            elements by using the style attribute in the
            element’s opening tag. Each style declaration is
            ended with a semicolon. Styles added in this
            manner are known as inline styles.</p>

          <h4>Separating HTML code from CSS code</h4>
            <p>It is common practice to separate content code in
            HTML files from styling code in CSS files. This can
            help make the code easier to maintain, by keeping
            the syntax for each file separate, and any changes
            to the content or styling can be made in their
            respective files.</p>


  <!-- Display and Positioning -->
         <h3>Display and Positioning</h3>

          <h4>CSS 'z-index' property</h4>
            <p>The CSS z-index property specifies how far
            back or how far forward an element will appear on
            a web page when it overlaps other elements.
            The z-index property uses integer values,
            which can be positive or negative values. The
            element with the highest z-index value will be
            at the foreground, while the element with the
            lowest z-index value will be at the back.</p>

          <h4>Fixed CSS Positioning</h4>
            <p>Positioning in CSS provides designers and
            developers options for positioning HTML elements
            on a web page. The CSS position can be set
            to static , relative , absolute or
            fixed . When the CSS position has a value of
            fixed , it is set/pinned to a specific spot on a
            page. The fixed element stays the same regardless
            of scrolling. The navigation bar is a great example
            of an element that is often set to position:
            fixed; , enabling the user to scroll through the
            web page and still access the navigation bar.</p>

          <h4>CSS display property</h4>
            <p>The CSS display property determines the
            type of render block for an element. The most
            common values for this property are block ,
            inline , and inline-block .
            Block-level elements take up the full width of their
            container with line breaks before and after, and
            can have their height and width manually adjusted.
            Inline elements take up as little space as possible,
            flow horizontally, and cannot have their width or
            height manually adjusted.
            Inline-block elements can appear next to each
            other, and can have their width and height
            manually adjusted.</p>

          <h4>CSS position: absolute</h4>
            <p>The value absolute for the CSS property
            position enables an element to ignore sibling
            elements and instead be positioned relative to its
            closest parent element that is positioned with
            relative or absolute . The absolute
            value removes an element entirely from the
            document flow. By using the positioning attributes
            top , left , bottom and right , an
            element can be positioned anywhere as expected.</p>

          <h4>CSS position: relative</h4>
            <p>The value relative of the CSS position
            property enables an element to be positioned
            relative to where it would have originally been on a
            web page. The offset properties can be used to
            determine the actual position of the element
            relative to its original position. Without the offset
            properties, this declaration will have no effect on
            its positioning, it will act as the default value
            static of the position property.</p>

          <h4>CSS float property</h4>
            <p>The CSS float property determines how far
            left or how far right an element should float within
            its parent element. The value left floats an
            element to the left side of its container and the
            value right floats an element to the right side
            of its container. For the property float , the
            width of the container must be specified or the
            element will assume the full width of its containing
            element.</p>

          <h4>The CSS clear property</h4>
            <p>The CSS clear property specifies how an
            element should behave when it bumps into
            another element within the same containing
            element.The clear is usually used in
            combination with elements having the CSS float property. This determines on which sides
            floating elements are allowed to float.</p>
